# Stellar-Blockchain---PS-Work
Code written during Practice School 1 for making querying functions in JavaScript.

This code has been written with assistance from the code snippets as shown on the Stellar Developers site.
Functions can be found in the StellarUtilities file.
The driver class uses these functions to carry out a transaction between three parties : buyer, seller and an escrow account.
The functions may be used and modified for other purposes as well.
